        <h1>What is Hibernoglyphics?</h1>
        <div>Hibernoglyphics is a syllabic writing system for Irish.</div>
        <br/>
        <div><i>But isn't Irish full of really complex syllable onsets and codas like "ml", "dhb" and "str"?</i></div>
        <br/>
        <div>Yes, but there are a few tricks to working around this. Here they are:
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, all dialects of Irish break up some syllable codas with a so-called "epenthetic vowel" (<i>guta cúnta</i>). Thus, <i>gorm</i> "blue" is really said as if it was spelt <i>goram</i>.</i></li>
                <li>Secondly, in Munster Irish this is taken a step further and consonant clusters like -thr- are broken up too: <i>athrú</i> becomes <i>atharú</i>.</li>
                <li>Thirdly, historically a lot of vowels were lost in the middle and end of Irish words: thus <i>inghean</i> "daughter" comes from Primitive Irish <i>INIGENĀS</i>. The final vowel was lost in a process called apocope, but it left its mark in the broad/slender quality of the final consonant. We can use this to our advantage: <i>damh</i> "ox" (nominative singular) can be written in our system as "daṁo" and <i>daimh</i> "ox" (genitive singular) can be written as "daṁi". Note that the lenition dot is used instead of a "h", this will be used in our system too (one of the minor exceptions to my decision to not use Latin script shapes for my writing system).</li></l>
                <li>Finally, the most complex syllable onsets are <i>scl, scr, str, spl, spr</i>. By making special characters for <i>sc, sp, st</i> (which are internally transcribed as <i>x, q, z</i>), we can make sure that no syllable will need more than two characters to transcribe its onset.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>We can apply these principles liberally to ensure that all words are writeable using a reasonable inventory of characters, and have a reasonable length in our system. Sometimes the resulting spellings will resemble Primitive Irish, such as <i>inghean</i> being spelt <i>iniġeno</i>, and as such this system has features of a highly etymological spelling, however that is not its aim.</div>
